# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
#
# Builds ONE container that runs the Express API (artifacts/api-server) and
# also serves the built frontend (artifacts/field-service-schedule-board) as
# static files, so the whole app deploys as a single Azure App Service
# (Web App for Containers) or Azure Container Apps instance.
#
# See AZURE_DEPLOYMENT.md for the required Azure resources and environment
# variables (DATABASE_URL, SESSION_SECRET, CLIENT_ID/TENANT_ID/CLIENT_SECRET,
# etc.) — none of those are baked into the image; they're supplied at deploy
# time as App Settings / Container Apps secrets.
#
# This is a single-stage build (not multi-stage). pnpm workspaces hoist
# dependencies via symlinks into a content-addressable store, which is fragile
# to split across build/runtime stages with a plain `COPY`. Building and
# running from the same image is a bit larger but reliable; shrink it later
# with a multi-stage `pnpm deploy` step if image size becomes a problem.
